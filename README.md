# TUV Nord Central API

The current internal system of TUV Nords is scattered to multiple applications. This caused data discrepancy and redundancy that caused a lot of complications in the operational process. The employee also needs to log in with different accounts for each application. We want to set this Central Data as a foundation to streamline all the internal applications and as a source of truth for any further system.
